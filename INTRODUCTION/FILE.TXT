java script allows object oriented programming by allowing following properties

-classes
-objects
-constructor
-prototypes
-inheritance

--class = buleprint 

class student {

}

--object = which executes the information of blueprint 

let studant1 = new student()

--constructor = which is simpally a method, which executes automatically when an object is created of a class

class student {

    constructor(){
        this.name: name;
        this.age: age;
        this.class: class;
    }

}

let studant1 = new student() the constructor is called heare automatically

--prototypes = a prototype is cleated of a clsass, the class object contain the prototypes is its shared memory 

studant.prototype.study = function () {
    console.log(`${this.name} his is average at avery thing but not good at any thing`)
}

syudant.study();

--inheritance =
