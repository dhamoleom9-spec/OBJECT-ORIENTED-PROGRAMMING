java script allows object oriented programming by allowing following properties

-classes
-objects
-constructor
-prototypes
-inheritance

--class = buleprint 

class student {

}

--object = which executes the information of blueprint 

let studant1 = new student()

--constructor = which is simpally a method, which executes automatically when an object is created of a class

class student {

    constructor(){
        this.name: name;
        this.age: age;
        this.class: class;
    }

}

let studant1 = new student() the constructor is called heare automatically

--prototypes = a prototype is cleated of a clsass, the class object contain the prototypes is its shared memory 

studant.prototype.study = function () {
    console.log(`${this.name} his is average at avery thing but not good at any thing`)
}

syudant.study();

--inheritance = 

agar koi class hay aur usme kutch kutch likha hay agar ap inhi property ko dusre class mi chahiye to use apan inharit kar sakte hay
class animal{
    constructor(eat,sleep){
        this.eat = eat;
        this.sleep = sleep;
    }
}
class dog extends animal{
    constructor(sound){
        super()
        this.sound = sound;
    }
}
let dog1 = new dog("bhau bhau.....")

--class expression 
storing a class in the veriable is called class expression

let animal = class{
    constructor(name,bread){
        this.name = name;
        this.bread = bread;
    }
}
let ani1 = new animal("charli","germanshepherd")

the hoisting is not working in the class expression 

--we cancreate a constructor without class syntax like follows

function User(name, email){
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
}

let user1 = new user("om dhamole","omdhamole123@gmail.com")
user();

--call
call is a function with specific this value

function callback(){
    console.log(`${this.name} is intalligent main`)
}

let obj = {
    name: "shubnam bhau bharsakde"
}

callback.call(obj)

--apply
apply is like the call, in which attributes are passed in form of array

function applyee(a,b){
    console.log(this.name, a + b)
} 

let objj = {
    name: "om"
}

applyee.apply(objj, [2,3])

--bind
bind wwhich written new function eith fixed this valus
function binddd(c , d){
    console.log(this.name, this.email, c - d)
}

let objjj = {
    name: " om dhamole",
    email: "ombhau134@gmail.com"
}

const nava = binddd.bind(objjj, 2,3)
nava()
